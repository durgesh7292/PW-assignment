      Some characters are reserved in HTML. If you use the less than (<) or
      greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.
      Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        < - Represents the less than symbol (<). It is used to display the
        symbol within HTML code without it being interpreted as an opening tag.
      </li>
      <li>
        > - Represents the greater than symbol (>). It is used to display the
        symbol within HTML code without it being interpreted as a closing tag.
      </li>
      <li>
        & - Represents the ampersand symbol (&). It is used to display the
        symbol within HTML code without it being interpreted as the start of an
        entity.
      </li>
      <li>
        " - Represents the double quotation mark ("). It is used to display the
        symbol within HTML code without it being interpreted as the start or end
        of an attribute value.
      </li>
      <li>
        ' - Represents the apostrophe ('). It is used to display the symbol
        within HTML code without it being interpreted as the start or end of an
        attribute value. Note that this entity is not supported in HTML4, but it
        is supported in HTML5.
