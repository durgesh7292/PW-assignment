      The metadata means information about data. The <meta /> tag regularly used
      to give watchwords, portrayals, author data, and other metadata that might
      be utilized by the program to deliver the document accurately or in simple
      words, it provides important information about a document. Adding the meta
      tag while making the webpage or website, is a good practice because search
      engines like Google search for this meta tag in order to understand the
      information provided by the website. It is also helpful if the user search
      for a specific website then the search engine result page will display
      snippets in search results that will provide information related to that
      website. These tags are basically used to add name/value pairs to describe
      properties of HTML documents, such as expiry date, author name, list of
      keywords, document author, etc ie., it is used to specify a character set,
      page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
      This tag is an empty element because it only has an opening tag and no
      closing tag, but it carries information within its attributes. A web
      document can include one or more meta tags depending on information, but
      in general, it doesnâ€™t affect the physical appearance of the document.
