      Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor that allows you to type
      shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. By using Emmet,
      email designers type less, saving both keystrokes and time when building a
      campaign. Also, relying on Emmetâ€™s autocompletion means fewer typos and
      missing tags, leading to more robust emails.
