        Tags are an essential part of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XML
        (eXtensible Markup Language). They are used to define the structure and
        appearance of content on a web page. Tags are enclosed within angle
        brackets (< >) and appear as opening and closing pairs, with the content
        placed between them.

      <dd>
        Elements are made up of tags and the content they enclose. They define
        the different parts of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images,
        links, and more. Each element serves a specific purpose and contributes
        to the overall structure and functionality of a web page.

        Attributes provide additional information about HTML or XML elements.
        They are placed within the opening tag of an element and consist of a
        name-value pair. Attributes can be used to modify the behavior,
        appearance, or functionality of an element.
